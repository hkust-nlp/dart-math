On January 3, 2019, the Chang'e 4 lunar probe successfully achieved the first soft landing on the far side of the moon in human history. It was another major achievement in China's aerospace industry. One key technical issue that needs to be solved for the landing on the far side of the moon is the communication between the ground and the probe. To solve this problem, the Chang'e 4 relay satellite \"Queqiao\" was launched, which orbits around the Lagrange point $L_{2}$ of the Earth-Moon system. The $L_{2}$ point is an equilibrium point located on the extension line of the Earth-Moon connection. Given the mass of the Earth as $M_{1}$, the mass of the Moon as $M_{2}$, the distance between the Earth and the Moon as $R$, and the distance from the $L_{2}$ point to the Moon as $r$, according to Newton's laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation, $r$ satisfies the equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{M_{1}}{(R+r)^{2}}+\\frac{M_{2}}{r^{2}}=(R+r) \\frac{M_{1}}{R^{3}}\n$$\n\nLet $a=\\frac{r}{R}$, and since $a$ is very small, the approximate calculation gives $\\frac{3 a^{3}+3 a^{4}+a^{5}}{(1+a)^{2}} \\approx 3 a^{3}$.
